# readme.so

The original Readme.so is an online editor to help developers make readmes for their project.
In this version, it still holds the originals in place with an addition to creating blog posts using [Github's Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)
and layout from Jekyll in this case, other Headless CMS's such as Hugo, NEXT,Gatsby, Gridsome, Vue and others uses.
You can now create your post right here and even download it and place it into the `posts` folder.

Check out the original developer and production site below. While your at it, see it live there and check out the updated version too.

## Deployment

We like Github deployments from time to time, but this time, we want to add [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) in the mix
of things.

## Installing/Updating NextJS:
First step is being sure your running the latest [NEXTJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js):

`npm install next` or `npm update next`

Most likely you should just be able to update here instead of installing as it should already be installed.

## Running the Dev Server

To run the dev server:

run `npm run dev` and navigate to `localhost:3000`
